# Optimisation Algorithms


This repository contains the algorithms developed during the course 2017-2018 of the Master's *[Modelling for Science and Engineering](http://www.uab.cat/web/estudiar/official-master-s-degrees/general-information/modelling-for-science-and-engineering-1096480962610.html?param1=1307112830469)* of the Autonomous University of Barcelona.

Some of the projects shown within this repository were mandatory during the course, whilst others have been unsupervised projects with no purpose but pure curiosity.


.* **Genetic Algorithms**. This project has consisted on the construction of a GA model that finds the solution for the *N-Queen Problem*. Different models can be found within its repository file and the report presented where those models are compared and discussed.

..* **Shortest Path**. This folder contains some toy models trying to emulate (or some silly models inspired of) the *Dijkstra Algorithm*. The model tries to find all shortest paths between different nodes of a graph.

.. * **Simulated Annealing**. This project has consisted on the construction of a SA model. The aim of this model is to find an optimal solution for a puzzle. This puzzle consists in carrying different items with different values and weightes on a truck, the goal is to maximize the value of the cargo without exceding a maximum weight allowed.
